				<h2><img src="images/pic_shideh1.jpg" align="right" />Shideh's Biography </h2>
			    <p>Shideh has been involved with dance and the arts all her life.  She started dancing at the tender age of six and became a professional ballerina when she was only thirteen.  In her sixteen years dancing for the Iranian Royal Ballet, Shideh became one of the principal dancers of the group as well as the prima ballerina in several major performances. Ballet is an interplay of multiple disciplines and techniques, dedicated to providing a visual feast. This has allowed Shideh to have a unique understanding on how design is perceived. </p>
		        <p> Over the past fifteen years, Shideh has lived and traveled on three different continents. During her time living in Jakarta, Indonesia and Singapore, Shideh began studying and collecting Asian art pieces and designs. After moving to London, she began to combine the two different cultural styles, creating her own Eurasian style.  Her international experience allows her to combine multiple cultural design and style cues into a very unique and contemporary design.<br />
		          <br />
		        Shideh's formal design education was completed in the summer of 2005 after receiving a degree from the Interior Design Institute of Newport Beach, California.<br />
			    <br />
		        <strong>Work History</strong><br />
Shideh was recently awarded a contract to redesign <em>The Hotel George</em> in Washington D.C.  Nicknamed the &quot;Hotel on the hill&quot;, this hotel has accommodated several major international diplomats, dignitaries and leaders.  The contract was completed in March of 2006.<br />
<br />
In addition to this, Shideh has also redesigned and remodeled several residential homes in Los Angeles, Laguna Niguel, and Palm Desert in California as well as Lansdowne, Virginia, and Miami, Florida.<br />
<br />
Her home in Palm Desert is her showcase, and can be visited by appointment. A virtual tour of that home is available in this site. For a list of references, please use the contact us page and we will send one out to you.</p>
